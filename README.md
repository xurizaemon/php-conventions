# drupol/php-conventions

Just so it's clear this isn't a fork of drupol/php-conventions I've replaced the default branch with this message.

This repo is a response to the issue raised in [drupol/php-conventions#1](https://github.com/drupol/php-conventions/issues/1), where the package and repo history was rewritten causing CI pipelines using it to break.

If you have a version of this package in your composer cache / project history and want to help recover those releases to the original project, this repo is open for you to MR that to.
